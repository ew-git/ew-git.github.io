Here are some miscellaneous gists related to R. Click through to Github for additional explanation.

### pdf-merge-text.r
A common problem when scanning using a one-sided scanner with a document feeder is ending up with two PDFs: one for the front of each page and one for the back. This script writes LaTeX which combines those two PDFs, so that you end up with front1, back1, front2, back2, etc.

### image-greyer.r
For every file ending in .png, .jpg, or .jpeg (and not beginning with blank-) in the current working directory, the script will generate a grey image of the same dimensions with text of the image name.

### npp-r-function-parser.xml
Notepad++ has a Function List Panel which, by default, lists the functions defined in the current document for common languages, including C and Python. This gist is a simple parser to provide the same functionality for R.
